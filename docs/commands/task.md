# Gok task

Scope: `Project`, `Service`

`Gok task` provides a tool to manage and execute a defined command from inside your meta yaml files.

## Pull

### Command: gok task pull namespace [name]

`Gok` allows you to pull predefined tasks from the `gokums-cli` github repo and put it into your meta file.
If you're in `Service` scope, pulled task is populated into `manifest.yaml`, or in the case of `Project` scope, task is put into `root.yaml`

If you don't specify `name`, `Gok` will list out all tasks on that namespace.
If the namespace does not exist, current available namespaces are `go`, `docker` and `local`

## Run

### Command: gok task run name

`Gok` merges tasks from `Project` scope and `Service` scope, then executes the combined task.
tFor how the tasks are merged, refer to [root.yaml configuration](../other/root.yaml.md).

`Gok` runs task by [templating](../others/templating.md) steps, judging whether to perform it or not by evaluating the `when` property, and executing them serially one after each other.

As an example, rRefer to the task called `build`, which is generated by default
It performs building a binary by calling `go build`.
