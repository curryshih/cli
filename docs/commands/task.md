### Gok task

Scope: `Project`, `Service`

`Gok task` provides a tool to manage and execute a defined command inside your meta yaml files.

### Pull

##### Command: gok task pull namespace [name]

`Gok` allows you to pull predefined tasks from the `gokums-cli` github repo and put it into your meta file. If you're in `Service` scope, pulled task is populated into `manifest.yaml`, or in the case of `Project` scope, task is put into `root.yaml`

If you don't specify `name`, `Gok` will list out all tasks on that namespace. If the namespace does not exist, current available namespaces are `go`, `docker` and `local`

### Run

##### Command: gok task run name

`Gok` merges tasks from `Project` scope and `Service` scope, then execute the combined task. For how the tasks are merged, refer to [others/root.yaml]((config/root.yaml.md)).

`Gok` runs task by [templating](others/templating.md) steps, judging to perform it or not by evaluating the `when` property, and executing them serially one after each other.

Take a look at the task called `build` is generated by default, it performs building a binary by calling `go build`.
